# About me

I am a cryptography researcher at Seoul National University. I received my Ph.D. in applied mathematics from Hanyang University, where I was a member of the [Cryptology & Algorithm Lab](https://cryptology-algorithm-lab.github.io). My research interests include constructing secure cryptographic algorithms and their real-world applications.
